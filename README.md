### Register the Listener and Send a Message
Spring AMQPâ€™s RabbitTemplate provides everything you need to send and receive messages with RabbitMQ. However, you need to:

* Configure a message listener container.
* Declare the queue, the exchange, and the binding between them.
* Configure a component to send some messages to test the listener.
